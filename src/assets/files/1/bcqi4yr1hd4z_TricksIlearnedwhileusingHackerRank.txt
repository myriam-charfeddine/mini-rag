Tricks I learned while using HackerRank:

--- print(i, end="") // print without a new line

--- print(*range(1, n + 1), sep="") 
// *range  => unpack the elements and return them as multiple arguments
// sep=""  => so the elemets don't be separated by a space

--- textwrap.wrap() is a function in Python's textwrap module used to split a string into a list of lines, with each line having a specified maximum width.
EX: 
import textwrap
textwrap.wrap(text, width=20)

----
df.iloc : index-based selection
df.loc : label-based selection

When choosing or transitioning between loc and iloc, there is one "gotcha" worth keeping in mind, which is that the two methods use slightly different indexing schemes.

iloc uses the Python stdlib indexing scheme, where the first element of the range is included and the last one excluded. So 0:10 will select entries 0,...,9. loc, meanwhile, indexes inclusively. So 0:10 will select entries 0,...,10
